## Installation

CanCanCan System works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'cancancan-system'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cancancan-system

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'cancancan-system', github: 'jonhue/cancancan-system'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g cancancan_system

To wrap things up, migrate the changes to your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

## Usage

To get started add CanCanCan System to your `Ability` class (`app/models/ability.rb`) and add the required `alias_action` for `:modify`:

```ruby
class Ability

    include CanCan::Ability
    include CanCanCan::System::Ability

    def initialize user
        alias_action :create, :read, :update, :destroy, to: :modify
    end

end
```

**Note:** The actual aliases (`:create, :read, :update, :destroy`) can be custom.

Lastly, to complete the integration, add the following to your `User` (or similar) model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belonger
    acts_as_belongable
end
```
