# CanCanCan System

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cancancan-system.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cancancan-system) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/cancancan-system.svg?branch=master" />

Conventions & helpers simplifying the use of CanCanCan in complex Rails applications. CanCanCan System simplifies authorizing collaborations, memberships and more across a complex structure of models.

To describe complex abilities CanCanCan System relies on two different constructs: ActiveRecord **objects**, and **relationships** of users to those objects.

CanCanCan System uses two attributes on *objects* to describe abilities:

* **ability:** Describes the default ability of users without a special relationship with an object.
* **visiblity:** Specifies whether an object is visible to other users than the creator.

CanCanCan System uses one attribute on *relationships* to describe abilities:

* **ability:** Describes the ability of a user with the related object.

`ability` can have any CanCanCan permission, `'admin'` (`:manage`), `'user'` (`:modify`) or `'guest'` (`:read`) as value while `visiblity` is limited to `public` and `private`.

## Installation

CanCanCan System works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'cancancan-system'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cancancan-system

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'cancancan-system', github: 'jonhue/cancancan-system'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g cancancan_system

To wrap things up, migrate the changes to your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

---

## Usage

To get started add CanCanCan System to your `Ability` class (`app/models/ability.rb`) and add the required `:modify` alias:

```ruby
class Ability

    include CanCan::Ability
    include CanCanCan::System::Ability

    def initialize user
        modify [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
    end

end
```

**Note:** The aliases (`:create, :read, :update, :destroy`) can be custom.

### Defining Abilities

CanCanCan System makes an `abilities` method available which simplifies setting up common abilities:

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Post, user
end
```

This is equivalent to:

```ruby
def initialize user
    public_abilities Post
    can :manage, Post, user_id: user.id if user
end
```

You can also use the `abilities` method with custom column names and polymorphic associations. This comes in handy when using the [NotificationsRails gem](https://github.com/jonhue/notifications-rails):

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Notification, user, column: 'target', polymorphic: true, public_abilities: false
end
```

This is equivalent to:

```ruby
def initialize user
    can :manage, Notification, target_id: user.id, target_type: user.class.name if user
end
```

Learn more about the `public_abilities` method [here](#public-abilities).

#### Public abilities

The `public_abilities` method defines the object-abilities without a `user` being present:

```ruby
def initialize user
    public_abilities Post
end
```

This is equivalent to:

```ruby
def initialize user
    can :manage, Post, ability: 'admin', visibility: 'public'
    can :modify, Post, ability: 'user', visibility: 'public'
    can :read, Post, ability: 'guest', visibility: 'public'
end
```

#### acts_as_belongable abilities

CanCanCan System integrates with the [acts_as_belongable gem](https://github.com/jonhue/acts_as_belongable) to make defining abilities for relationships dead simple.

Let's say our users can be a member of multiple organizations:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belongable
    belongable :member_of_organizations, 'Organization', scope: :membership
    has_many :organizations
end

class Organization < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belonger
    belonger :members, 'User', scope: :membership
    belongs_to :user
end
```

We would then just do:

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Organization, user do
        belonger_abilities Organization, user, scope: :membership
    end
end
```

**Note:** This can be done in the same way with `belongable_abilities` for `belongable` relationships.

Now we are able to add members to our organizations and set their abilities:

```ruby
Organization.first.add_belongable User.first, scope: :membership, ability: 'admin'
```

**Note:** The `scope` option is optional. If omitted, the defined abilities will apply to all belongings regardless of their scope.

#### Membership abilities

Now, let us assume that we have another model: `Post`.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belongable
    belongable :member_of_organizations, 'Organization', scope: :membership
    has_many :posts
    has_many :organizations
end

class Organization < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belonger
    belonger :members, 'User', scope: :membership
    has_many :posts
    belongs_to :user
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :user
    belongs_to :organization
end
```

You want the posts of an organization to be accessible for its members. It doesn't get any simpler than this:

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Post, user do
        organization_abilities Post, user, scope: :membership
    end
end
```

**Note:** The `scope` option is optional. If omitted, the defined abilities will apply to all belongings regardless of their scope.

You are also able to perform some customization:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :user
    belongs_to :object, polymorphic: true
end
```

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Post, user do
        organization_abilities Post, user, scope: :membership, column: 'object', polymorphic: true
    end
end
```

Another option is to use the [acts_as_belongable gem](https://github.com/jonhue/acts_as_belongable) to associate posts with organizations:

```ruby
class Organization < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belonger
    belonger :members, 'User', scope: :membership
    belonger :posts, 'Post'
    has_many :posts
    belongs_to :user
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belongable
    belongable :organizations, 'Organization'
    belongs_to :user
end
```

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Post, user do
        organization_abilities Post, user, scope: :membership, acts_as_belongable: true
    end
end
```

**Note:** If your `acts_as_belongable` association in the `Post` model is not following the CanCanCan System naming convention, you can override it by passing the `column` option.
