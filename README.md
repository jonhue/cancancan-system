# CanCanCan System

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cancancan-system.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cancancan-system) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/cancancan-system.svg?branch=master" />

Conventions & helpers simplifying the use of CanCanCan in complex Rails applications. CanCanCan System simplifies authorizing collaborations, memberships and more across a complex structure of models.

To describe complex abilities CanCanCan System relies on two different constructs: ActiveRecord **objects**, and **relationships** of users to those objects.

CanCanCan System uses two attributes on *objects* to describe abilities:

* **ability:** Describes the default ability of users without a special relationship with an object.
* **visiblity:** Specifies whether an object is visible to other users than the creator.

CanCanCan System uses one attribute on *relationships* to describe abilities:

* **ability:** Describes the ability of a user with the related object.

`ability` can have any CanCanCan permission, `'admin'` (`:manage`), `'user'` (`:modify`) or `'guest'` (`read`) as value while `visiblity` is limited to `public` and `private`.

## Installation

CanCanCan System works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'cancancan-system'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cancancan-system

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'cancancan-system', github: 'jonhue/cancancan-system'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g cancancan_system

To wrap things up, migrate the changes to your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

## Usage

To get started add CanCanCan System to your `Ability` class (`app/models/ability.rb`) and add the required `:modify` alias:

```ruby
class Ability

    include CanCan::Ability
    include CanCanCan::System::Ability

    def initialize user
        modify [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
    end

end
```

**Note:** The aliases (`:create, :read, :update, :destroy`) can be custom.

Lastly, to complete the integration, add the following to your `User` (or similar) model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_belonger
    acts_as_belongable
end
```

### Defining Abilities

CanCanCan System makes an `abilities` method available which simplifies setting up common abilities:

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Post, user
end
```

This is equivalent to:

```ruby
def initialize user
    public_abilities Post
    can :manage, Post, user_id: user.id if user
end
```

You can also use the `abilities` method with custom column names and polymorphic associations. This comes in handy when using the [NotificationsRails gem](https://github.com/jonhue/notifications-rails):

```ruby
def initialize user
    abilities Notification, user, column: 'target', polymorphic: true, public_abilities: false
end
```

This is equivalent to:

```ruby
def initialize user
    can :manage, Notification, target_id: user.id, target_type: user.class.name if user
end
```
